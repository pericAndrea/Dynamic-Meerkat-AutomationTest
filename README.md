# Dynamic-Meerkat-AutomationTest
This repository contains the Cypress automation script for the Dynamic Meerkat web application.

# Installation
Before running the script, you need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

To install Node.js, please visit https://nodejs.org/.

Once you have Node.js installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:


` npm install `

or

` yarn install `

# Running the Script

To run the Cypress automation script, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

` npm run cypress:open `

or

` yarn cypress:open `


This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select the tests to run and view the results.

Alternatively, you can run the tests in headless mode by running the following command:


` npm run cypress:run `

or

` yarn cypress:run `


This will run the tests in the command line without opening the Test Runner.

# Test Files

The test files are located in the cypress/integration directory. You can add, modify, or delete test files as needed.
